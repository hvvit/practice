# Mathematics

## Example 1:

### Given an integral number N. The task is to find the count of digits present in this number.

for example:
```
N = 7897

No of digits 4
following are digits:
7
8
9
7
```

the normal approach taken was till the number was zero divide it by 10 and count iteration on every number.<br />

the best case approach of O(1) is just use log to the base 10 from the maths.h and add 1 to it. and use floor to round it at the lowest roundoff.<br />

my solution filename: countdigits.cpp<br />
best solution: bestSolutioncountdigits.cpp<br />

How do we arrive at the solution:
```
so let me assume that there will be like n digits in number num

so we can also observe that the number will lie between 10^(n-1) and 10^n.
so when we apply log base10 to all of them in the following equation
10^(n-1) <= num < 10^n
we apply the log base 10 in the above equation we get
n-1 <= log10(n) < n
and we get
n <= log10 + 1 < n + 1
```
